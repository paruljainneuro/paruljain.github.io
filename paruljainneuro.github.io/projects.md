	<h1>EEG evidence of low-level speech processing in severe brain injury.</h1>
	<p>In survivors of severe brain injury, residual cognitive abilities are assessed traditionally via behavioral tests such as the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and, recently, via EEG/fMRI-based tests of motor imagery. However, these tests rely on language comprehension. Given the hierarchical nature of language, there could be a subset of patients with no evidence of language comprehension but with evidence of partial language processing. We explored this question using EEG recording of brain injury patients as they passively listened to a section of a popular story. Our results confirm that there are patients with no evidence of language processing in behavioral or motor imagery tests but with evidence of low-level language processing in EEG.

	<h1>Hermite functions-based measure of non-Gaussianity</h1>
	<p>Measures of Gaussianity are the basis of normality tests and independent component analysis, two widely used methods in neural data analysis. As a result, there are many ways to measure non-Gaussinity, but none directly captures the signal distribution's shape. We explored the suitability and feasibility of a Hermite functions-based measure of non-Gaussianity to normality tests and ICA. We compared it to existing ones using synthesized non-Gaussian datasets and simulated realistic EEG datasets. The method shows promise as a normality test with applicability for artifact removal in EEG datasets.</p>
