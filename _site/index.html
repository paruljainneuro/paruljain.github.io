	<p>Hi! I am a graduate student in the lab of Dr. Jonathan D. Victor at Weill Cornell Medicine, New York. I expect to defend in March 2023. </p>
	<p> I am engineer by training and studied computer science at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. Courses in computational biology sparked my interest and led me to do a minor in Systems Biology. After college, I worked with Dr. Emre Aksay at Weill Cornell Medicine and Dr. Mark Goldman at University of California Davis on modeling the oculomotor integrator in zebrafish. Pursuing my interest in neuroscience, I joined the department of Phisiology and Biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine as a gradute student.</p>
	<p>I am interested in understanding the neural basis of behavior, particularly in humans, and in the development of tools and technologies that will assist in its pursuit. During my thesis, I worked on two projects: the first project probed language processing in severe brain injury patients and the second project proposed a measure of non-Gaussianity applicable as a normality test and an ICA contrast function for the ana
