	<p>Hi! I am postdoctoral associate at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Siani. I am interested in understanding the neural basis of behavior, particularly in humans, and in the development of tools and technologies that will assist in its pursuit.
	</p>
	<p>Currently, I am working closely with Drs. Daniela Schiller, Jennifer Foss-Feig, and Xiaosi Gu, to understand the neural mechanisms of psychiatric diseases. See projects for details.
	</p>
	<p>I received my Ph.D. at Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, under the guidance of Dr. Jonathan D. Victor. During my thesis, I worked on two projects: the first project probed language processing in severe brain injury patients and the second project proposed a measure of non-Gaussianity applicable as a normality test and an ICA contrast function for the analysis of neural data.</p>
	<p> I am engineer by training and studied computer science at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. Courses in computational biology sparked my interest and made me switch fields. My predoctoral research projects include modeling the oculomotor integrator in zebrafish and modeling causality in gene regulatory networks.</p>
